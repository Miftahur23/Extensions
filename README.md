### **Problem**

In the Apps Script Editor, changes made to the code do not automatically reflect in the deployed web app. As a result, developers must manually reload the web app tab after each save to view the updates.

### **Solution**

This extension streamlines the development workflow by allowing developers to specify a test URL via the extensionâ€™s input field. Once configured, the extension automatically detects when the code is saved in the Apps Script Editor and reloads the corresponding web app tab, eliminating the need for manual refreshes.
